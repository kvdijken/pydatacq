    An example class to demonstrate the LiveData class.
    It produces a FM modulated sinewave in the interval [-4ùõë:4ùõë],
    with modulation frequency of 3Hz and frequency
    deviation of 0.25Hz

    Values have been choosen to demonstrate update speed
    of the LiveWindow class as well, although this LiveFMSine
    class can be used in other consumers as well.
